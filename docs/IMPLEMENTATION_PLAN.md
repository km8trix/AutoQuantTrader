# AutoQuantTrader implementation plan

## Current implementation status

The substantial local Phase 0 foundation/walking thread and bounded Phase 1A/1B
point-in-time ingestion and admission slices are implemented as a local,
simulation-only browser application. Production Auth0/OIDC server sessions and
an enabled server SSE stream remain Phase 6 hardening work; their contracts and
browser client seams exist, but this status does not claim those production
controls are complete. In addition to the walking thread and safety controls, a
worker-driven recorded JSONL adapter now
publishes deterministic content-addressed raw/normalized Parquet, PostgreSQL
catalog metadata, causal revision selection, security lifecycle, corporate
actions, data quality, quarantine, and functional browser views.

Phase 1B now provides the provider-neutral source seam, strict evidence evaluator,
durable admission reports, and browser visibility. It is **implemented locally
against synthetic contract fixtures; licensed vendor admission remains pending**.
ADR 0011 now narrows the first external implementation to session-defined daily
data because the 2026-07-16 probe found Sharadar SFP and Tiingo EOD sample rows
for DIA, IWM, QQQ, and SPY while Massive raw trades and quotes returned HTTP 403.
The canonical model now supports exchange-session `1d` bars, and the first
strict SFP capture/parser archives provider bytes and preserves their explicit
adjustment bases. Because SFP supplies adjusted OHLCV and only one unadjusted
close, it deliberately cannot emit canonical raw execution bars. Future exact-
page capture requires a reviewed, date-effective authorization artifact with a
terms digest; output is fixed beneath the ignored `.local` tree. Capture
manifests bind the observed response-column schema, and offline datasets bind
the exact bytes to pinned calendar semantics. ADR 0012's safe Tiingo slice is
now implemented as strict offline qualification against repository-owned
synthetic EOD fixtures. It uses a Tiingo-specific raw-candidate basis, binds
provider, dataset, scope, schema, calendar, receipt, and synthetic evidence kind
into deterministic identity, and refuses canonical-bar or admission-evidence
conversion. It deliberately precedes and does not authorize exact-page capture
or a production `HistoricalBarSource`: publication/vintage timing, venue
provenance, identity authorities, and licensed storage rights remain unresolved.
Massive remains the deferred intraday candidate. No credential,
authorization, synthetic fixture, or capture has been
treated as admission or evidence that a vendor's real history, entitlement,
identifiers, calendars, corrections, or corporate actions have passed
qualification. The trader remains `not_ready`; no paper or live broker/data
adapter is enabled. The remaining Phase 1 vendor admission and Phases 2-8 below
retain their exit gates.

## Delivery strategy

Build a narrow, safety-complete vertical slice before adding breadth. Each phase
ends with an executable artifact and a hard acceptance gate. The first execution
slice is intentionally limited to one operator, one trade-enabled strategy, one
brokerage account, a small liquid ETF allow-list, regular market hours, whole
shares, and DAY market orders.

Calendar estimate: 16-20 weeks for one experienced full-time engineer to reach a
credible paper-trading MVP, assuming vendor/broker onboarding is straightforward.
This is followed by an evidence-based paper soak with a minimum 4-8 week calendar
window. Strategy profitability is not schedulable and is never inferred from
paper fills.

Four evidence layers remain distinct:

1. **Backtest:** research robustness and economic plausibility under declared
   assumptions.
2. **Replay/shadow:** causal correctness and offline/online decision parity.
3. **Paper:** broker workflow, recovery, reconciliation, controls, and operations.
4. **Minimum-size live canary:** actual routing, liquidity, latency, and execution
   behavior.

Passing one layer cannot substitute for another.

## Phase 0 - decisions, skeleton, walking thread, and browser shell (week 1)

### Build

- Confirm the ETF universe, 1-minute-or-slower frequency, regular-hours session,
  long-only/whole-share/DAY-market-order scope, broker, data entitlement, account
  type, and deployment environment.
- Record ADRs for temporal semantics, raw/adjusted data, security identity,
  ledger/accounting, engine build-versus-adopt, broker capability/recovery,
  account lease/fencing, experiment governance, and live authority.
- Create the Python and React/Vite workspaces, PostgreSQL migrations,
  configuration, structured logs, health endpoints, quality tooling, Docker
  Compose, and CI.
- Scaffold the desktop-browser shell, permanent environment banner, routing,
  Auth0/session contracts, generated API types, resumable SSE client, error
  boundaries, and deterministic development fixtures.
- Establish dependency rules: synchronous pure domain core, application ports,
  infrastructure adapters, and thin composition roots.
- Implement a one-symbol walking thread from a fixed market tape through a no-op
  or buy-and-hold strategy, mandatory risk decision, simulated submission, fill,
  balanced ledger entry, position projection, and browser overview trace.
- Define measurable budgets for data age, strategy deadline, approval TTL, clock
  drift, submission uncertainty, reconciliation, alert delivery, and a reference
  backtest workload. The initial conservative values and change controls are in
  [Operational budgets](OPERATIONAL_BUDGETS.md). Values may be tuned later, but
  they cannot be undefined.

### Exit gate

- A clean checkout runs formatting, typing, unit tests, migration checks, API,
  worker, trader stub, and browser application with one documented command.
- The walking thread is visible and causally traceable in the browser.
- The walking thread proves the planned dependency direction and event shape.
- Execution has no code path that omits a persisted risk decision.
- Paper and live configuration/credential schemas are structurally distinct.
- Open architectural decisions that affect Phase 1 are resolved, not deferred.

## Phase 1 - point-in-time data plane (weeks 2-3)

### Current Phase 1A implementation

- Complete locally: provider-neutral recorded source, canonical raw bars,
  availability-time revisions, stable fixture security IDs, effective-dated
  ticker/tradability/universe facts, pinned DST/half-day calendar fixtures,
  strict corporate actions, deterministic Parquet, atomic manifests, quality
  quarantine, manifest-pinned causal reads, APIs, worker, and browser views.
- Proven locally: identical re-ingestion is idempotent; shuffled rows produce
  identical checksums; a correction available at 09:32 is invisible at 09:31;
  adjusted values cannot satisfy the raw execution bar; ticker change,
  delisting, DST, half-day, missing-session, split, and dividend fixtures are
  covered by tests.
- Newly complete: session-defined daily interval validation, immutable bounded
  SFP page/manifest capture behind reviewed storage authorization, fixed local
  output, cursor and digest verification, observed response-column schema
  binding, pinned-calendar semantic binding, per-symbol/session coverage,
  explicit adjusted field semantics, and a hard block against mapping mixed SFP
  fields to raw execution bars.
- Newly complete: an offline Tiingo EOD contract parser and synthetic
  qualification corpus covering strict schema and numeric bounds, documented-
  raw-candidate versus adjusted separation, split/dividend fields, exact
  symbol/session coverage, receipt-time knowledge, and scope/calendar-bound
  deterministic identity. Results are permanently `synthetic_contract_only`
  and fail closed on canonical-bar and admission-evidence conversion. This
  slice performs no network capture, makes no live-payload claim, and cannot
  implement or satisfy the production `HistoricalBarSource` contract.
- Still required for the Phase 1 exit gate: confirm licensed use, verify the
  frozen DIA, IWM, QQQ, and SPY allow-list plus a non-tradable lifecycle corpus,
  freeze identifier/calendar/action authorities, complete reviewed capture
  authorization, qualify genuinely raw daily fields from exact retained bytes
  or a validated reconstruction, implement the resulting
  `HistoricalBarSource`, and run the admission suite against licensed payloads.
  Synthetic tests and research captures cannot satisfy this gate.

### Current Phase 1B admission implementation

- Complete locally: provider-neutral historical-source bundles, strict source-ID
  isolation, adapter/profile metadata, frozen coverage and symbol requirements,
  deterministic admission specifications and evidence, independent-review
  semantics, immutable PostgreSQL reports/checks, and browser admission status.
- Proven locally: mixed-source rows fail before storage; fixture profiles cannot
  claim a license; synthetic and recorded fixtures remain `blocked` regardless
  of their technical results; source/specification/evidence/report digests are
  deterministic; missing, duplicate, unknown, temporally impossible, or
  self-approved evidence fails closed.
- Still external: choose and license the actual vendor product, freeze the
  production ETF allow-list and identifier/calendar authorities, implement its
  adapter, supply legally usable payloads, and obtain an independent approval.
  Until then no admission report can be `admitted` and Phase 1 remains open.

### Build

- Stable security IDs with effective-dated ticker, venue, tradability, listing,
  delisting, and point-in-time universe membership.
- Canonical market event fields: event/interval time, vendor publication,
  receipt, availability, ingestion, source sequence, schema, and revision.
- Immutable raw and normalized Parquet partitions in content-addressed local
  storage; PostgreSQL stores ordered manifests, metadata, jobs, and quality
  results. Cloud object storage is an adapter, not a Phase 1 dependency.
- Historical vendor adapter, exchange calendars, session labels, watermark and
  late-event policy, corrections, quarantine, and idempotent publication.
- Explicit split, dividend, merger, symbol-change, and delisting events. Keep raw
  execution series separate from adjusted research views.
- Data contracts and checks for gaps, duplicates, OHLC validity, staleness,
  extreme returns, inconsistent revisions, and timezone/session errors.
- Browser views for ingestion jobs, manifests, security lifecycle, corporate
  actions, feed entitlement, quarantine, and data-quality issues.

### Exit gate

- Re-ingesting identical input produces the same partition checksums and no
  duplicate facts; a revised vendor record creates a new revision.
- A correction available at 09:32 is invisible to a 09:31 simulated decision.
- Dataset manifests reproduce the exact ordered partitions, calendar, universe,
  corporate-action version, schema, and first-seen/revised policy.
- Fixtures cover DST, half days, missing sessions, split/dividend accounting,
  ticker changes, and at least one delisted security.
- Adjusted values cannot flow into execution or ledger APIs by construction.

## Phase 2 - canonical engine, ledger, order reducer, and minimum risk (weeks 4-6)

### Build

- Simulated clock and deterministic ordering over availability-time events.
- Watermark-complete `MarketBatch`, read-only causal strategy context, clock
  callbacks, versioned strategy state, target portfolio, and target expiry.
- Append-only balanced ledger for fills, fees, cash flows, dividends, splits,
  settlement, marks, and realized P&L; cash/position/P&L are projections.
- Portfolio valuation and full target-to-intent-batch conversion for one active
  strategy.
- Canonical intent, risk, submission, broker-order, cancel, execution, and
  correction reducers. The simulated broker is the first `BrokerPort`; live
  execution will reuse these reducers.
- Conservative next-event DAY market-order simulation first. Add bar-based limit
  scenarios only as explicitly ambiguous stress models.
- Atomic risk decision/reservation for instrument/session, stale price, quantity,
  notional, cash, account exposure, duplicates, pending order exposure, pause,
  and halt. Approval is versioned, single-use, and expires.
- Account-scoped coordinator interface and lease/fencing data model, even though
  this phase runs only against simulation.
- Browser strategy-version selection, schema-validated parameters, backtest
  launch/progress, performance charts, trade trace, and ledger/position views.

### Exit gate

- Buy-and-hold matches a hand-calculated raw-price fixture including fees,
  dividends, splits, settlement policy, and final ledger balances.
- A close-based decision cannot fill from the same bar; time-shifting future data
  or corrections cannot alter earlier targets.
- Repeating a run yields semantically identical decisions, exact order/ledger
  fields, and metrics within declared tolerances.
- Property tests prove balanced postings, cash/security conservation, single-use
  reservations, valid cumulative fills, and safe late-fill/correction handling.
- Parallel intent batches cannot reserve the same cash or accidentally create a
  short position.
- Simulated execution is unreachable without a current persisted approval.

## Phase 3 - research validity, live tape, shadow replay, and research UI (weeks 7-9)

### Build

- Versioned feature artifacts with input lineage, lookback/publication lag,
  missing-data policy, fitted training window, and immutable fitted state.
- Batch and incremental feature implementations with differential replay tests.
- Experiment families that record every attempted, failed, canceled, and
  completed trial; bounded worker-process concurrency and resource quotas.
- Chronological and nested walk-forward evaluation, purging/embargo for
  overlapping labels, benchmark/cost stress, parameter stability, uncertainty,
  and declared multiple-testing treatment.
- Audited final-holdout access and promotion criteria frozen before reveal.
- A live market-data adapter with feed-entitlement metadata, quote/NBBO support,
  per-symbol freshness, gap backfill, reconnect watermarking, and captured event
  tapes. Run the candidate in shadow mode without any broker submission.
- CLI- and browser-accessible provenance/performance reports, experiment
  comparison, feature lineage, captured-tape playback, feed freshness, and
  replay-versus-shadow views.

### Exit gate

- Batch and incremental features/targets agree on the same captured tape.
- A reconnect backlog cannot emit one fresh intent per stale bar; expired targets
  are discarded and audited.
- Any trade can be traced to its availability-time inputs, feature artifacts,
  target, risk snapshot, code/image digest, and configuration.
- Parameter sweeps cannot inspect the final holdout or mutate shared run state.
- Reports label exploration, validation, and confirmation evidence and declare
  return, annualization, benchmark, cash-flow, cost, and uncertainty conventions.

## Phase 4 - paper broker execution, recovery, and trading UI (weeks 10-12)

### Build

- Alpaca paper adapter plus explicit capability matrix for order types, TIF,
  sessions, tick/lot/fraction rules, client IDs, status mapping, pagination,
  data feed, and request budgets.
- Database-enforced account lease and monotonically increasing fencing
  generation, revalidated immediately before every broker side effect. Disable
  automatic failover because the broker cannot enforce the fence; manual
  takeover uses lease expiry, an in-flight safety interval, prior-runtime stop
  confirmation where possible, and the reconciliation barrier.
- Immutable submission attempts with payload hash and deterministic client order
  ID. On ambiguous responses, enter `UNKNOWN`, perform bounded delayed lookup by
  the same client ID, and never blindly resubmit.
- Inbound inbox/deduplication for at-least-once broker stream and snapshot events.
- Startup/reconnect barrier: enter `RECONCILING`, buffer stream events, obtain
  paginated account/order/fill/activity snapshots with overlap, apply both
  idempotently, repeat until two views converge, then become ready.
- Explicit policy that the v1 broker account is application-exclusive. Any
  unexplained manual/foreign order or economically relevant mismatch halts new
  exposure until adopted or resolved by the operator.
- Durable control states and precedence for pause, drain, flatten, halt, and
  explicit re-arm. Reserve broker request capacity for cancels/reconciliation.
- Quote-based freshness/collar recheck and risk-reservation revalidation
  immediately before dispatch.
- Browser deployment workflow, target/order/fill trace, coordinator ownership,
  unknown submissions, reconciliation differences, durable command receipts,
  and pause/drain/flatten/halt controls.

### Exit gate

- Paper lifecycle works for accepted, rejected, partial, filled, canceled,
  cancel-rejected, expired, late-fill, bust/correction, and provider-specific
  status events.
- Two normal trader processes and rolling-deploy overlap cannot both remain
  authorized. Lease or database loss fails closed; forced/manual takeover is
  quarantined and reconciled before it may submit.
- Killing the process at every submission boundary never creates an untracked
  duplicate; delayed client-ID visibility and transient “not found” are safe.
- Fill-during-cancel, stream/snapshot gaps, pagination, duplicate/out-of-order
  events, manual broker activity, and stale reconnect backlogs pass fault tests.
- No reconciliation mismatch is silently tolerated to enable new exposure.
- The same captured tape produces equivalent strategy targets in replay and
  shadow/paper before execution effects.

## Phase 5 - advanced risk, observability, and operations UI (weeks 13-15)

### Build

- Versioned advanced risk rules for session loss/drawdown, concentration,
  leverage, volatility, spread/slippage, reject rate, rate limits, clock/data
  health, unknown duration, and reconciliation duration.
- Circuit breakers that default to no new exposure and never auto-resume.
- React/Vite dashboard for environment identity, freshness, coordinator owner,
  strategy/deployment state, orders, fills, account/ledger positions, risk
  reservations/decisions, reconciliation differences, alerts, and audited
  controls.
- OpenTelemetry correlation across market batch, target, reservation, attempt,
  broker event, fill, ledger posting, and reconciliation.
- Alerts for every critical failure with delivery checks and escalation policy.
- Supervised strategy subprocess with deadline/resource enforcement; timeout or
  crash pauses new entries while order/risk/reconciliation handling continues.

### Exit gate

- Every broker call is traceable to a current fence and single-use risk approval.
- Boundary/property tests prove configured limits including pending-cancel and
  unknown-order exposure.
- Kill-state matrix drills are timed and audited; drain and flatten report
  explicit completion or residual exposure rather than assuming success.
- Strategy timeouts, alert-channel failures, data gaps, broker disconnects, and
  risk trips produce the intended state and require manual re-arm.
- The UI cannot call the broker directly and remains an observational/control
  client over durable commands.

## Phase 6 - deployment, browser security, and operational hardening (weeks 16-18)

### Build

- Separate worker/trader roles, pools, quotas, and service identities; managed
  PostgreSQL, secret manager, object storage, restricted network, and immutable
  images/configuration.
- Separate paper and live projects, accounts, credentials, databases, and alert
  routes. No mutable paper state is promoted to live.
- Expand/migrate/contract schema procedures, trading-aware drain before deploy,
  application-version compatibility, and forward-fix strategy.
- Backup, point-in-time restore, retention, deployment rollback-to-halt, and
  disaster-recovery drills with declared RPO/RTO.
- Runbooks for startup/shutdown, database/data/broker outage, `UNKNOWN` order,
  partial/late fill, manual broker activity, mismatch, strategy crash, kill
  states, broker-dashboard intervention, and incomplete flatten.
- Daily automated reconciliation, ledger integrity check, and signed report.
- Production CSP/CSRF/session validation, desktop-browser bundle splitting,
  table virtualization, server-side chart downsampling, SSE recovery, and
  Chromium/Firefox/WebKit end-to-end coverage at desktop viewports.

### Exit gate for paper-trading MVP

- A fresh environment deploys from immutable artifacts without manual database
  edits; restore and recovery objectives are demonstrated.
- Critical simulated failures reach the operator within the declared budget.
- Game days cover database loss, broker/data outage, clock drift, strategy crash,
  split brain, unknown order, reconciliation mismatch, and kill-state recovery.
- At least five consecutive complete market sessions finish without unexplained
  order, fill, cash, position, ledger, or reconciliation differences before the
  longer soak begins.

## Phase 7 - supervised paper soak (minimum 4-8 weeks plus evidence quotas)

### Operate and measure

- Run the exact signed candidate artifact/configuration during every intended
  session; strategy code remains frozen while execution defects are diagnosed.
- Compare expected and observed batches, targets, reservations, orders, fills,
  costs, positions, P&L, latency, rejects, gaps, reconnects, and reconciliations
  daily.
- Require predeclared evidence quotas: complete sessions, generated targets,
  accepted/rejected/canceled/partial orders, reconnects, risk trips, and at least
  one controlled drill of each critical recovery path. If the strategy naturally
  does not generate an event, inject it in a drill rather than waiting forever.
- Continue across representative market conditions when practical; elapsed
  calendar time alone is insufficient.

### Operational promotion gate

- Zero unresolved order, fill, cash, position, ledger, or reconciliation
  discrepancies.
- Every incident has a documented cause, corrective action, and regression test.
- Lease fencing, recovery, risk limits, alerts, kill states, deploy, restore,
  halt, and manual broker intervention passed their drills.
- Replay-to-paper decision differences are fully explained by availability or
  modeled execution effects.

### Strategy validation gate

- Final criteria were signed before holdout/soak results were revealed.
- Out-of-sample results remain acceptable under declared benchmark, uncertainty,
  cost, impact, and capacity stresses.
- Trial count and selection process are disclosed; paper fill profitability is
  excluded as evidence of real execution quality.
- A human signs the immutable strategy, risk, data, and runtime promotion record.

## Phase 8 - minimum-size live canary (never automatic)

### Preconditions

- Confirm brokerage permissions, market-data licenses, tax implications, and
  legal/compliance obligations for the actual operating model.
- Use the separate live environment, one strategy, the narrow allow-list, and
  the smallest sensible capital/order size with tighter limits than paper.
- Re-run live readiness, reconciliation, broker capability, market-data
  entitlement, and manual-intervention checks immediately before the session.

### Rollout

1. Live shadow mode: targets and risk decisions only.
2. One-symbol, minimum-size canary with direct supervision.
3. Fixed observation window and post-session reconciliation/report.
4. Gradual universe/capital increases only after predeclared gates.
5. Any unexplained divergence immediately halts new exposure; “rollback” means
   manage existing orders/positions safely, not blindly run an older binary.

Live promotion is an operational decision, never a CI action.

## Cross-cutting definition of done

Every change includes:

- typed public contracts and documented invariants;
- unit/property tests plus integration or broker/data contract tests when a
  boundary changes;
- explicit time, retry, expiry, idempotency, deduplication, and failure behavior;
- forward-compatible migration and mixed-version deployment analysis;
- metrics/logs that diagnose failures without credentials or sensitive data;
- audit coverage for user-facing controls and configuration;
- updated ADR/runbook documentation;
- a performance measurement when the hot event loop or data scan path changes.

## Initial CI pipeline

1. Ruff format/lint, static typing, and architecture import-boundary tests.
2. Unit and property tests for domain, ledger, risk, and order reducers.
3. Temporal leakage, batch/incremental differential, and semantic replay tests.
4. PostgreSQL integration, migration compatibility, lease/fencing, and job tests.
5. Broker/data recorded-contract tests plus optional sandbox tests.
6. End-to-end tape -> target -> reservation -> attempt -> fill -> ledger replay.
7. Web lint, typecheck, generated-contract drift, component tests, and production
   build from Phase 0 onward; Playwright desktop-browser workflows as routes land.
8. Dependency, license, image, and secret scanning.
9. Reference backtest/live-loop performance regression test.

## Suggested first backlog (ordered)

1. Scope, event-time, data-adjustment, ledger, lease, broker, and experiment ADRs.
2. Workspace, CI, configuration, logging, health, and import boundaries.
3. One-symbol walking thread with mandatory risk and balanced ledger.
4. Stable security identity and bitemporal market-event primitives.
5. Raw/normalized Parquet publication, quality checks, and dataset manifest.
6. Corporate-action/security-lifecycle fixtures including a delisting.
7. Watermark-complete strategy batch and deterministic simulated clock.
8. Ledger, projections, target conversion, canonical order reducers.
9. Simulated broker, atomic reservations, and conservation/property tests.
10. Reproducible backtest report and experiment-family registry.
11. Live market-data capture, quote freshness, shadow replay, feature parity.
12. Alpaca capability matrix and recorded fixtures.
13. Account lease/fence, submission attempts, inbox, and reconciliation barrier.
14. Fault tests before enabling the first paper submission.
15. Advanced breakers, alerts, complete operations UI, deployment, backups, and
    runbooks.

## Decisions required before Phase 1

| Decision | Default | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Instruments | Small fixed set of liquid U.S. ETFs | Minimizes security-lifecycle and liquidity state space while fixtures mature |
| Frequency | 1-minute bars or slower | Keeps v1 outside latency-sensitive/HFT architecture |
| Sessions | Regular market hours only | Avoids extended-hours order/feed/liquidity semantics |
| Direction/quantity | Long-only, whole shares | Avoids short borrow/locate and fractional-order differences |
| Orders | DAY market orders, next-event simulation | Smallest causally defensible execution slice |
| Active strategies | One per brokerage account | Defers netting, virtual sleeves, internal crosses, and fill allocation |
| Broker | Alpaca paper | Paper-first API; capability contract preserves future portability |
| Data | Daily-first: immutable Sharadar research capture and Tiingo offline synthetic EOD qualification implemented locally; Tiingo capture and `HistoricalBarSource` blocked; Massive intraday deferred; none admitted | Adjustment basis, publication/vintage timing, venue/identity authorities, historical revisions/universes, licensed storage/use, and live quote scope drive validity |
| Account model | Explicit cash or margin policy | Determines settlement, buying power, ledger, and risk semantics |
| Hosting | One region, managed PostgreSQL, object storage | Reliable non-HFT footprint with separable operational/research I/O |
| UI | Desktop-browser React/Vite workspace, incremental from Phase 0 | Makes research and operations observable without adding native/mobile scope |

Options, futures, crypto, shorting, fractional shares, extended hours,
multi-strategy accounts, multi-user SaaS, or sub-second decisions each require a
fresh scope/ADR review before implementation.
